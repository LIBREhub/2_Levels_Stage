Before you start building the station you will need to source all the components listed in our [bill of materials]{BOM}.

## Instructions

These instructions will take you through how to assemble the 2-levels version of the station. There is also a [3-levels version](https://librehub.github.io/3_Levels_Stage/) if you need a room for placing your boards and protected them in the station.

The assembly is broken up into several steps:
